The Odin Project - Recipes

I created this HTML webpage to showcase what I learned in the HTML chapter of The Odin Project series (My first steps to becoming a full stack developer!)

Key Learning Accomplishments:

- Writing the HTML Boilerplate
- Creating text and formatting (bold, italics) to create meaning
- Importing images and linked (absolute and relative paths)
- Use of Git and Github, learned best practices
